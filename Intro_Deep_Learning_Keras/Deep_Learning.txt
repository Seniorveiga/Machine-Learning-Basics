Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning where we consider nodes that have different weights and they
train the model through the time. The starting point is the scalar product.

We are having 3 parts right now in our Deep Learning process:
 - Input
 - Nodes
 - Output

You canhave several nodes to increase the precision.

IMPORTANT: How are defined the "weights"?
ANSWER: The model training process sets them to optimize predictive accuracy.
        In fact, the complexity of the interactions scales with the layers
