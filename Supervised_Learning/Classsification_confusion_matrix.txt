    If we want to reduce wasted effort, returning the highest proportion of TRUE POSITIVES, we should use the PRECISION.
Example: If a customer is good for a sales department.

    If we want to minimize the number of FALSE NEGATIVES, we consider the RECALL as a relevant metric.
Avoiding the presence of cancer in some hospital patients.

    We can use also the F1-Score for minimizing False negatives.

Accuracy: True predictions / Total sum of metrics.
